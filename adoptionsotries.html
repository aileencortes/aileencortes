                <h4>Peanut's Story</h4>
                <p>Peanut was adopted on March 24th, 2022. She had spent almost 8 months in the shelter waiting on her forever home, until one day
                someone special came to visit her and fell in love with her and her personality. Now she spends her surrounded by laughter and affection,
                long walks in the park, and stealing jars of Peanut Butter. Peanut has also developed a great sense of fashion since she's been adopted and 
                now asks her owner to dress her up everyday and even has special outfits for holidays.

                <p> Angelo was adopted on June 12th 2022. He spent 4 months in the shelter until one lucky day someone came into the shelter and began 
                    playing with him. After that day his now new filed for the adoption papers and took him home in the days following. Angelo has developed 
                    a love for fetch, long walks in the park and also opening his owner Amazon boxes to add to his personal collection. In this picture we can

                <h4>Ricky's </h4>
                <p> Ricky was adopted on November 16th 2022. He spent 6 months in the shelter until eventually one day a lucky family came to say hello to him and
                    decided to take him home. Ricky is a great family dog and loves to run around in his new backyard and play with leaves. However, Ricky's favorite 
                    thing to do is to play fetch as you can see.
