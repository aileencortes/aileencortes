                <h4>Bean</h4>
                <p> Bean was recently rescued about a month ago. He was rescued from an abandoned home and also had signs of malnourishment.
                    He is almost back to a normal and healthy weight and is also slowly becoming less shy and more playful. Bean will soon be 
                    ready to look for his FurEver home.

                <h4>Rosco and Rosa</h4>
                <p> Rosco and Rosa was recently rescued about a four months ago. They're unable to go into a forever home at the moment due
                    to high levels of trauma and fear of water. Rosco and Rosa also suffer seperation anxiety when apart from each other so 
                    when ever you see Rosco or Rosa their best friend isn't far behind. Rosco and Rosa are slowly being helped by our staff everyday until they are 
                    ready to start looking for their FurEver homes.

                <h4>Craig</h4>
                <p> Craig was recently rescued about a two months ago. We received a call about a lose animal in an abandoned farm and decided to 
                    go search for him. What we first though was a brown dog turned into Craig the brown goat. Craig is still to young to look for his
                    FurEver home but once hes older he will be more than ready.
